Technologies and Techniques Utilized:

Language: C# for backend logic and application development.
Object-Oriented Design: Employ OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for scalable and maintainable code architecture.
Data Management: Utilize file handling or SQLite for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Exception Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure application stability.
Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation covering project structure, class diagrams, and usage instructions for developers and end-users.
Purpose and Benefits:
This project serves as an exemplary case study for understanding advanced OOP concepts and practical application development in C#.
